This application allows users to create, update, and delete appointments and customers with data stored and retrieved from a MySQL database.
The application converts database UTC times to system default times and checks new appointment start and end times against EST business hours.
The application also displays reports based on appointment type per month, appointments for each contact, and appointments for each customer.

Designed and implemented with Java, JavaFX, and a MySQL relational database. Database deployed with AWS RDS.
