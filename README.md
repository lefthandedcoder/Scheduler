# Scheduler
JavaFX Scheduling App for Software 2

This application allows users to create, update, and delete appointments and customers with data stored and retrieved from a MySQL database.
The application converts database UTC times to system default times and checks new appointment start and end times against EST business hours.
The application also displays reports based on appointment type per month, appointments for each contact, and appointments for each customer.
